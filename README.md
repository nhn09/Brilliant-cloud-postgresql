# Brilliant cloud postgresql
 PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a  relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and uses SQL as the language.
 
 ### Why postgres? 
 
 * free
 
 * opensource(in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.)
 
 * robust (robustness of the database is a fundamental issue in the design of systems which must survive crashes, maintaining data consistency and system availability.)
