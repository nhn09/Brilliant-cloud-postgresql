# Starting postgresql
 PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is an object-relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and uses SQL as the language.
 
### Why postgres? 
 
 * free
 
 * opensource(in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.)
 
 * robust (robustness of the database is a fundamental issue in the design of systems which must survive crashes, maintaining data consistency and system availability.)


#### What is a database?

Random data becomes valuable if they are arranged in efficiecnt ways.


Database is a way of Managing data in an arranged manner creating multiple tables made of columns and rows, for furthur operations like 

* Storing 
* Manupulation
* Retrive

And when the tables are inter-related, it is named as **Relational** database.


| Column1       |   Column2     |Column3  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:  |
| This is       | row           | 1!      |
| This is       | row           | 2!      |
| This is       | row           | 3!      |


for these acts to do upon large number of data,the magic spells are found in SQL- structured Query Language. A powerful yet easy programming language.
